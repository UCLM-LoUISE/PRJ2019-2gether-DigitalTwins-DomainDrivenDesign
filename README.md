# Undergrate Dissertation Project by Juli치n Abell치n Abad

Welcome to the repository for Juli치n Abell치n Abad's Undergraduate Dissertation project in Computer Engineering Degree at UCLM (Albacete). This project focuses on creating a Human Digital Twin to evaluate bullying among children in school playgrounds.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive system for assessing bullying behavior in school environments. By utilizing a Human Digital Twin, we aim to simulate and analyze interactions among children to identify instances of bullying.

## Background

This project has been a result of my research on Human Digital Twins during my employment as a researcher in I3A in LoUISE group.

## Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

This project has been developed following the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD). As a result, our project features a hexagonal architecture and leverages design patterns and best practices in software development.

### Key Features:

- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Ensures a clean separation of concerns and promotes maintainability.
- **Design Patterns**: Implements various design patterns to solve common problems effectively.
- **Best Practices**: Adheres to best practices in software development for robust and scalable code.
