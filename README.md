# Domain-Driven design for development of Human Digital Twins 
by Julián Abellán Abad

This project focuses on creating a Human Digital Twin to evaluate bullying among children in school playgrounds. It has been funded by 2gether Project.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to develop a Human Digital Twin for assessing bullying behavior in school environments. By utilizing a Human Digital Twin, we aim to simulate and analyze interactions among children to identify instances of bullying.

## Background

This project has been a result of my research on Human Digital Twins during my employment as a researcher in I3A in LoUISE group.

## Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

This project has been developed using the principles of **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, following the guidelines presented at:

Macías, A., Navarro, E., Cuesta, C. E., & Zdun, U. (2023, March). [Architecting digital twins using a domain-driven design-based approach](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICSA56044.2023.00022). In 2023 IEEE 20th International Conference on Software Architecture (**ICSA 2023**) (pp. 153-163). IEEE.

As a result, our project features a hexagonal architecture and leverages design patterns and best practices in software development.

### Key Features:

- **Digital Twins**: adheres most of the properties expected of a DT such as representativeness, entanglement, memorization, predicatability, etc.
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Ensures a clean separation of concerns and promotes maintainability.
- **Design Patterns**: Implements various design patterns to solve common problems effectively.
- **Best Practices**: Adheres to best practices in software development for robust and scalable code.
